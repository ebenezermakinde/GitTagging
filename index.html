      <h2>What are git tags</h2>
      <p>Tags are ref's that point to specific points in Git history. Tagging is generally used to capture a point in
        history that is used for a marked version release (i.e. v1. 0.1). A tag is like a branch that doesn't change.
        Unlike branches, tags, after being created, have no further history of commits.</p>
